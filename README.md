1) I would fit my automated tests in my recipe project development pipeline within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed because it would automatically help catch bugs early/ before merging to main. 
2) No
3) I believe Navigation is gives a more well-rounded assessment since it examines the process of moving from one page to another, whereas Snapshot mode focuses more on assessing a page's state at that moment . 
4) Three things that can be improved:
   1) Serve images that are appropriately sized
   2) Use a <meta name = "viewport"> tag with width 
   3) Preconnect to required origins
